        <p>i want to cut down on my screentime but its hard. im willing to admit, im not special and im not immune. i love having an endless stream of stimulus, information, and connection at my fingertips. if im bored but also too tired to create, i go to youtube. but at the end of the day, it means nothing. now, ive moved past feeling like i need to be productive 24/7 and i realize rest is valuable, but im also realizing how empty the internet is. i dont get anything out of it half the time. i dont want to be numb.<br>i recently read fahrenheit 451, if you couldnt tell. and it woke me up to feelings i was already having.<br>i plan to read more and go outside more. its going to be hard to ignore the numbers, the likes and views and subscribers. i wont ignore them entirely, and i wont stop animating. but i need to disconnect and find <b>what really makes me happy.</b> the algorithm is addictive to both creator and viewer. i want to create and watch because i want to, not because i feel a pull to do so. i dont want to lose myself. i dont want to become dependent. but i fear im already heading there. so, im taking a step back. im going to go outside on nice days and read books on bad days. im going to break the cycle. if im bored, im going to ask myself what i want to do, instead of waiting for an algorithm to find it for me.</p>
